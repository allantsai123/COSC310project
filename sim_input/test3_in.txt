Good afternoon.
I want to go to Mexico.
Tijuanna.
I'm not sure, what are the biggest cities?
Ok. Can I drive to Tijuanna?
Wow that's far, how about fly?
Ok. Can you book me a hotel too?
Yeah, I can afford $100 a night.
Ok I'll take that. Can I cancel my reservation if I need to?
Once I'm there how can I get around Mexico?
What is there to do while in Mexico?
How far is it from Tijuanna to Juarez?
What is the weather like there?
What is the weather like in Tijuanna?
Ok. And I should bring my passport as well?
Great, thanks! Goodbye.
