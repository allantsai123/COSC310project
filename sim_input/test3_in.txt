Good afternoon.
I want to go to Cuba.
I'm not sure, what are the biggest cities?
Ok. Can I fly to Havana?
How far is the flight?
Ok. Can you book me a hotel?
Yeah, I can afford $100 a night.
Ok I'll take that. Can I cancel my reservation if I need to?
Once I'm there how can I get around Cuba?
What is there to do while in Cuba?
How far is it from Havana to Varadero?
What is the weather like there?
What is the weather like in Varadero?
Ok. And I should bring my passport as well?
Great, thanks! Goodbye.
