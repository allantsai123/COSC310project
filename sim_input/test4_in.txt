Good afternoon.
I want to go to Mexico.
I'm not sure, what are the biggest cities?
Tijuanna then.
How far is it?
Ok. Can I drive to Tijuanna?
How about fly?

Ok. Can you book me a hotel too?
Yeah, I can afford $100 a night.
Ok I'll take that. Can I cancel my reservation if I need to?
Once I'm there how can I get around Mexico?
What is there to do while in Mexico?
How far is it from Tijuanna to Mexico City?
What is the weather like in Tijuanna?
Ok. And I should bring my passport as well?


Great, thanks! Goodbye.
