Howdy!
I want to go to Cuba.
What are the biggest cities there?
Interesting. How far is it from Santa Lucia to Santiago de Cuba?
Ok. I'm pretty broke, can I drive there?
No? Ok, I'd like to fly to Cuba instead.
How far is it to Havana from Vancouver?
Sounds great. I'm new to travelling, what language do they speak there?
What are some activities that I can do while I'm there?
Wow great! How can I get around Cuba?
Ok, I'd like to book a hotel too.
Well, I said I'm broke. Probably $60 a night.
Can I cancel my reservation if I need to?
One last thing, what's the weather like in Havana right now?
Thanks, bye!
