I'd like to go to Mexico.
Cancun. 
Can I drive there?
Ok, can I fly then?
How far is it from Kelowna to Cancun?
What can I do in Cancun?
How far is it from Cancun to Chichen Itza?
I don't drive though. How can I get around?
Can I go on a cruise out there?
Can you help me find a hotel?
Are there any good places to eat?
I can only afford $80 a night though.
Can I cancel my reservation later if needed?
Oh ok, well then I'd like to go soon. What's the weather like?
Is there anything else I should know?
Alright thanks. What are the other big cities in Mexico?
Maybe I'll go to Mexico City.
How far is Cancun from Mexico City?
Do I need a passport while I'm there?
Can you help find me a hotel there as well?
I can afford $80 a night.
I'm not too sure about those places. What hotels do you have for $100 a night?
Are there any good places to eat?
Do people speak English there?
What other things are there to do?
Do you offer any cruises in the area?
I'm thinking of going to Juarez too, how far is Juarez from Tijuana?
What would be the best way to get there?
Could you help me book a hotel there too?

Ok, I have a lot to think about. Bye.
