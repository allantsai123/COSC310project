Hi!
I'd like to go to Mexico.
Mexico City. Can I drive there?
Ok fine. Can I fly then?
How far is it from Kelowna to Cancun?
What are the other big cities in Mexico?
What can I do in Cancun?
How far is it from Cancun to Chichen Itza?
I don't drive though. How can I get around?
Can you help me find a hotel?
I can only afford $80 a night though.
Can I cancel my reservation later if needed?
Oh ok, well then I'd like to go soon. What's the weather like?
Is there anything else I should know?
Ok thanks, bye!
